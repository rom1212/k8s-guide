### Install Docker
Which version is good? [kubeadmin installation guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/install-kubeadm/#installing-kubectl) says:
```
Version 1.12 is recommended, but v1.10 and v1.11 are known to work as well. Versions 1.13 and 17.03+ have not yet been tested and verified by the Kubernetes node team.
```

Older versions of docker (docker-engine version 1.11.2) can be found in Google's older instructions of kubeadm (it is now removed).
```
apt-get update && apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | apt-key add -
cat <<EOF >/etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main

apt-get update
apt-get install -y docker-engine

# docker without sudo
sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker

```

### Build
